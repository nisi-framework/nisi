# Welcome to NISI
This is the Non-Integer System Identification (NISI) code of the [High Enthalpy Flow Diagnostics Group (HEFDiG)](https://www.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/raumtransporttechnologie/diagnostik_hochenthalperstroemungen/) at the Insitute of Space Systems (IRS), University of Stuttgart. 
This code enables the surface heat flux reconstruction by in-depth temperature measurements.
A calibration procedure with a known and well-defined input surface heat flux is mandatory.
The NISI code is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0. The licence can be found in [LICENCE.md](LICENSE) and the list of contributors in CONTRIBUTORS.md.

# Documentation and Setup
The documtentation is avialable in the [User Handbook](200720_NISI_Handbook.pdf) and Matlab is required.
